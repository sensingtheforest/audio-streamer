# The install.sh installs msmtp, a simple app to send emails. This is the config file.
# To use it, you need an email account. This is how to do it with Gmail.

# Generate an app password from a google account.
# You can do it only if you have 2-factor-authentication (2FA) on. 
# Check if you have it and then go to:
# https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
# Give a name, it won't affect how the password works and you won't be asked that name again.
# Save the password and keep in mind that if you close the page, you won't be able to see the password again.

# Enter your Gmail address in the 'from' and 'user' fields.
# For 'password', use the app password you generated earlier.

# When you're done editing, save the file as ~/.msmtprc
# (Note: the tilde ~ means your home directory, and the dot makes it a hidden config file.)

# IMPORTANT! This code doesn't take care of encryption and you write the email credentials 
# here, so make sure that access to these lines is secure, or the email address doesn't 
# contain sensitive information.


# Set default values for all following accounts.
