# The install.sh installs msmtp, a simple app to send emails. This is the config file.
# To use it, you need an email account. This is how to set it up with Gmail.

# Step 1: Generate an app password from your Google account.
# You can only do this if you have 2-factor-authentication (2FA) enabled.
# Check if you have it, then go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
# Choose a name for the app password (any name — it doesn’t affect functionality).
# IMPORTANT: Copy and save the password right away — you won’t be able to see it again after closing the page.

# Step 2: Enter your Gmail address in the 'from' and 'user' fields below.
# For the 'password' field, use the app password you just generated (not your main Gmail password).

# Step 3: Save this file as ~/.msmtprc (from project folder sudo mv msmtprc___o.txt ~/.msmtprc)
# (Note: ~ means your home directory, and the dot makes it a hidden file.)
# Then, secure the file so only you can read it:
# Run: chmod 600 ~/.msmtprc

# IMPORTANT: This setup does not encrypt your credentials.
# Your email address and app password are stored in plain text.
# Use a dedicated or non-sensitive Gmail account if possible, and protect this file.


# Set default values for all following accounts.

auth           on
tls            on
tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
logfile        ~/.msmtp.log
